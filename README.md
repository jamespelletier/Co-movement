Fig 3: To generate intensity kymographs and velocity maps along line through MTOCs, as in Figs 3 and 4

Fig 5: To estimate viscosity based on expansion of photoreleased fluorescein cloud

Fig 7: To estimate transport of organelles based on flux of fluorescence intensity

Fig 8: To track and analyze transport of beads functionalized with dynein
